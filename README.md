Adjustments to Ticketing System Strategy
* It is essential for all incoming alerts to be assigned a severity level, along with defined expectations for response and resolution times by the SRE team. This protocol is crucial to effectively prioritize tasks. If alerts cannot be seamlessly integrated into this prioritization process, they require reconfiguration.
* Analysis indicates that 22 out of 30 tickets are associated with EndpointRegistrationTransientFailure. This type of failure typically resolves on its own, and immediate action may be unnecessary. Instead of setting an alert that demands immediate SRE involvement, it might be more productive to investigate the underlying cause of these failures. If deemed non-critical, such alerts could potentially be disabled to ensure that all alerts necessitate direct action. Concurrently, the SRE team should investigate the root cause of these alerts. Solutions like bash scripts or cloud automation tools (e.g., Azure Function Apps) could be employed to address these issues automatically, without requiring human intervention.
* Errors linked to batch processing job failures in the LLM indicate significant issues that require attention. Typically, such problems would necessitate an on-call SRE to restart an upload job or an ETL data pipeline. To reduce the need for such interventions, it may be advantageous to automate retries for these jobs upon failure. This could be achieved through manually triggered pipelines or cloud automation tools, which can execute scripts based on the jobâ€™s status conditions.
Assuming these adjustments are implemented, the volume of actionable tickets could potentially decrease from 30 to 5. This reduction would make the workload more manageable for the on-call SRE team, focusing their efforts on non-transient failures that genuinely require human analysis and intervention for resolution.
